# `@atrilabs/shared-layer-lib`

This library contains components that may be opened from more than one layer. One such example is `UploadContainer` that is responsible for uploading static assets, selecting from existing static assets etc. The `UploadContainer` is used in layers like `asset-manager-layer` and `component-style-layer`.
